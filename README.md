# fancy-maps
React components for creating Leaflet maps

Usage
-----
Use `gulp` to start the live reload server, which opens a browser with the basic demo. See `gulpfile.js` for more gulp tasks.

Components
----------

#### `LeafletMap`
Instantiates a new Leaflet map.

Example: `<LeafletMap lat="29.817178" lon="-95.4012915" minZoom="2" maxZoom="20" zoom="10" />`

For more information, see examples/basic-map.html (running `gulp` will automatically open this file in a browser).
